The eBay Listing Simple Mode functionality is no longer supported because a number of modifications were implemented in order to simplify and make work with M2E Pro more convenient. As the current configurations do not require any special skills or advanced experience, the Simple Mode is not going to be of use any longer.

The concept of M2E Pro global settings was changed. Now, only the ability to enable/disable Channels is available in general Magento Configurations (in Stores > Settings > Configuration > Multi Channels section).<br/><br/>
Moreover, the License management options, Logs Clearing configurations, Synchronization Logs, etc. are available in M2E&nbsp;Pro menu for each Integration separately. Navigate to Configuration > Settings section of the Integration you are using to specify the settings which will best suit your needs.
